## 🔄 ScrapeOps Proxy

This Pinterest spider uses [ScrapeOps Proxy](https://scrapeops.io/proxy-aggregator/) as the proxy solution. ScrapeOps has a free plan that allows you to make up to 1,000 requests which makes it ideal for the development phase, but can be easily scaled up to millions of pages per month if needs be.

You can [sign up for a free API key here](https://scrapeops.io/app/register/main).

### Installation
To use the ScrapeOps Proxy you need to first install the proxy middleware:

```bash
pip install scrapeops-scrapy-proxy-sdk
```

### Configuration
Then activate the ScrapeOps Proxy by adding your API key to the `SCRAPEOPS_API_KEY` in the `settings.py` file.

```python
SCRAPEOPS_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
SCRAPEOPS_PROXY_ENABLED = True

DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = {
    'scrapeops_scrapy_proxy_sdk.scrapeops_scrapy_proxy_sdk.ScrapeOpsScrapyProxySdk': 725,
}
```
